:::warning CPU miner notice
Gminer is a CPU miner. CPU mining is only practical on test networks; on mainnet it is not competitive. Use GPU or scrypt ASIC for mainnet.

### Install `gminer` on Mac
#### **Mac with apple silicon**
Download [gminer-darwin-arm64-v0.1.1-beta.tar.gz](https://github.com/flokiorg/grpc-miner/releases/download/v0.1.1-beta/gminer-darwin-arm64-v0.1.1-beta.tar.gz) then extract the archive:

```bash
tar -xvf gminer-darwin-arm64-v0.1.0-alpha.tar.gz
chmod +x gminer
```

#### **Mac with Intel chip**
Download [gminer-darwin-amd64-v0.1.1-beta.tar.gz](https://github.com/flokiorg/grpc-miner/releases/download/v0.1.1-beta/gminer-darwin-amd64-v0.1.1-beta.tar.gz) then extract the archive:

```bash
tar -xvf gminer-darwin-amd64-v0.1.0-alpha.tar.gz
chmod +x gminer
```
&nbsp;

### Install on Linux
Download [gminer-linux-amd64-v0.1.1-beta.tar.gz
](https://github.com/flokiorg/grpc-miner/releases/download/v0.1.1-beta/gminer-linux-amd64-v0.1.1-beta.tar.gz) then extract the archive:

```bash
tar -xvf gminer-linux-amd64-v0.1.0-alpha.tar.gz
chmod +x gminer
```

&nbsp;

### Install on Windows
Download [gminer-windows-386-v0.1.1-beta.zip](https://github.com/flokiorg/grpc-miner/releases/download/v0.1.1-beta/gminer-windows-386-v0.1.1-beta.zip) then extract the archive.

&nbsp;

## Configuration
Before running the miner, ensure a configuration file (`gminer.conf`) exists in the same directory as the `gminer` executable file. You can download a [sample config file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flokiorg/grpc-miner/refs/heads/main/sample-gminer.conf) from grpc-miner repository.

You need to update the following parameters:

**Mining pool endpoint**
```ini
pool = solo.example.com:5055
```

Find below the list of community-known pools:
| Author | Dev fee | Pool | Port |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| myf | - | gpool.myfloki.com | 5055 |

You‚Äôre encouraged to create your own pool, set a developer fee if desired, and share it with the Flokicoin community in **#Mining** channel on [Discord](https://flokicoin.org/discord).

**Mining addresses**

You can specify one or more mining addresses:
```ini
miningaddr = YOUR_FLOKICOIN_ADDRESS_1
miningaddr = YOUR_FLOKICOIN_ADDRESS_2
```

**Threads**

Set the number of CPU threads to dedicate for mining. By default, if unspecified, gminer uses all available threads.
```ini
threads = 16
```

&nbsp;

## How to run
**On Mac and Linux:** Navigate to the directory containing the extracted binary and run:

```bash
./gminer
```

üí° On macOS, authorize `gminer` by navigating to System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí General and click ‚ÄúOpen Anyway‚Äù to trust the developer.


**On Windows:** Navigate to the directory containing the extracted `gminer.exe` and double-click it or run it from the command line:
```bash
gminer.exe
```

üí° If Windows Defender or another antivirus blocks `gminer.exe`, you might need to explicitly allow or unblock it.

&nbsp;

## Monitoring
You can monitor the mining performance and status directly in the terminal. The information includes:

- Hashrate
- Blocks found
- Possible errors

&nbsp;

## Troubleshooting and recommendations
- Verify that your `gminer.conf` file is in the correct directory and that pool addresses, mining addresses, and ports match your intended configuration.
- On macOS, authorize `gminer` in System Settings and mark the developer as trusted.
- Verify the server address and port in `gminer.conf`.
- Ensure your internet connection is active.
- Regularly update the `gminer` from the releases page.
