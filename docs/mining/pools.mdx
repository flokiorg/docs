Disclaimer
- Pools and miners listed here are third‑party. Verify binaries and configs yourself and prefer sandboxed testing before production use.

Fpool
- Fpool offers solo and shared mining options and publishes examples and configuration help: https://fpool.net

Compatible Miners (scrypt)
- ccminer (NVIDIA): https://github.com/tpruvot/ccminer
- CGMiner (ASIC/GPU): https://github.com/ckolivas/cgminer
- BFGMiner (ASIC/GPU): https://github.com/luke-jr/bfgminer
- nevermore (GPU): https://github.com/brian112358/nevermore-miner
- cpuminer (CPU; testnet/learning only): https://github.com/pooler/cpuminer

Notes
- Mainnet: use GPU or scrypt ASIC. CPU mining is not competitive; reserve cpuminer for testnet or experimentation.
- AuxPoW: If the pool supports merge mining with a scrypt‑family parent (e.g., LTC/DOGE) and forwards AuxPoW to Flokicoin, follow the pool’s specific instructions. Details vary by pool.

Stratum Basics
- URL: `stratum+tcp://POOL_HOST:PORT`
- Username: your Flokicoin payout address (or pool account)
- Password: often `x` or pool‑specific token
