:::danger[Disclaimer]
Pools and miners listed here are third‚Äëparty. Verify binaries and configs yourself and prefer sandboxed testing before production use.
:::

## Pools
- [fpool.net](https://fpool.net) Mining has never been so easy üêü (solo, PPLNS)
- [viaflc.com](https://viaflc.com) More Coins Same Power (PPLNS, merge-mining)


### Notes
- Mainnet: use GPU or scrypt ASIC. CPU mining is not competitive; reserve cpuminer for testnet or experimentation.
- AuxPoW: If the pool supports merge mining with a scrypt‚Äëfamily parent and forwards AuxPoW to Flokicoin, follow the pool‚Äôs specific instructions. Details vary by pool.


## Stratum Basics
- URL: `stratum+tcp://POOL_HOST:PORT`
- Username: your Flokicoin payout address (or pool account)
- Password: often `x` or pool‚Äëspecific token
