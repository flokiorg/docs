Lokichain is the public, permissionless blockchain that secures Flokicoin. Flokicoin Core is the reference node software: it validates blocks and transactions, enforces consensus rules, and exposes network and wallet interfaces.

## How Lokichain works

- Network: peer-to-peer protocol for block and transaction propagation.
- Consensus: rule set governing block validity and chain selection, evolved via FIPs.
- Node software: Flokicoin Core implements validation, mempool, mining RPCs, and wallet/RPC interfaces.
- Interfaces: P2P, JSON‑RPC, and streaming where applicable.
