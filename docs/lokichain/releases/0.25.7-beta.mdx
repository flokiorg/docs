This is a minor beta release of Flokicoin Core with a new per-block difficulty retarget algorithm (Digishield-style), AuxPoW header and consensus support, testnet feature updates, RPC corrections, and build/test improvements. This release schedules `MAINNET ACTIVATION` for both Digishield and AuxPoW via chain parameters. All mainnet nodes must upgrade before the activation heights below to avoid chain splits.

## Notable changes

- Consensus: Digishield difficulty retarget
  - Introduces a per-block exponential moving average retarget toward the target spacing with amplitude divisor 8.
  - Applies bounded damping each step (min 0.75x, max 1.5x of target spacing influence) to reduce volatility.
  - Supports min-difficulty on late blocks where enabled by chain parameters.
  - Integrates into validation and mining (next-required-bits, block template target) and expands unit/full-block tests.

- P2P/Wire: AuxPoW header support
  - Adds AuxPoW structures (coinbase, merkle branches, parent header) and serialization helpers.
  - Extends `BlockHeader` with AuxPoW flag and ChainID utilities plus optional AuxPoW payload encode/decode.
  - Updates `MsgBlock` decoding to parse AuxPoW payloads when present; adds coverage for read/write paths.
  - Consensus: AuxPoW is activated on mainnet at the height listed below.

- Testnet/regtest updates
  - Enables SegWit and Taproot features on testnet where configured.
  - Tunes `MinHighPriority` and increases the `MaxLoki` bound used in RPC amount validation.

- RPC fixes and improvements
  - Aligns reported P2P protocol version with `wire.ProtocolVersion` and fills `getinfo` fields (subversion, localservices, connections_in/out, localaddresses) from live server state.

- Tooling and tests
  - Adds `make testexport` target and a deterministic test-data exporter.
  - Unifies block dataset loader with mandatory network-magic validation; refactors call sites.
  - Adds an end-to-end difficulty validation over curated datasets and emits steady-state tuning metrics.

- Build and configuration
  - Drops local `replace` override for `flokicoin-neutrino` to avoid developer-only paths.
  - Prints a single startup banner with semantic version during config load; refactors ASCII-art constants.

## Compatibility

- Mainnet will activate Digishield and AuxPoW at fixed heights (below). These are consensus changes and constitute a hard fork at activation. All miners, validators, and services must upgrade before those heights.
- AuxPoW wire support remains backward compatible for non-AuxPoW headers until activation height.
- No database format changes are introduced.

## Activation schedule (mainnet)

- Digishield difficulty retarget: activates at height 115,000 (`DigishieldActivationHeight` in `chaincfg/params.go`).
- AuxPoW consensus: activates at height 115,840 (`AuxpowHeightEffective` in `chaincfg/params.go`).

These activations are parameterized in `repos/flokiorg/go-flokicoin/chaincfg/params.go` under `MainNetParams`.

## Upgrade notices

- Mainnet node operators: upgrade to 0.25.7-beta before heights 115,000 (Digishield) and 115,840 (AuxPoW) to remain on the canonical chain.
- Testnet/regtest operators should upgrade to participate in the updated difficulty and feature policies.
- Application developers should re-vendor/update to pick up RPC schema fixes and wire additions related to AuxPoW.

## RPC changes

- `getinfo` now reports accurate `subversion`, `localservices`, `localservicesnames`, `connections_in`, `connections_out`, and `localaddresses`.
- Reported max protocol version aligns with `wire.ProtocolVersion` (70016).

## Build system and tooling

- New `make testexport` target to export block datasets for deterministic tests.
- Removed local `replace` for `flokicoin-neutrino` to produce clean module graphs in builds.

## Tests and QA

- Unified block loader enforces network magic and uses buffered, full-length reads.
- Added E2E difficulty validation with metrics output for steady-state analysis.
- Curated, smaller test datasets improve determinism and CI time.
