Welcome to tWallet — a terminal UI (TUI) wallet for Flokicoin focused on speed, clarity, and self‑custody.

Two major lines are available:

- v1 (Neutrino light client): Latest, trust‑minimized, no external Electrum server required.
- v0 (Electrum client): Legacy, requires you to point at an Electrum server.

If you’re unsure which to use, choose v1.

:::note
Currently, tWallet is the only available wallet. More wallets will be listed here as they become available.

## What “t” stands for

“tWallet” is a TUI app. It runs in your terminal and keeps interactions efficient and scriptable. No browser, no heavyweight GUI.

## Versions

### v1 — Neutrino (recommended)

Neutrino ([BIP157](https://bips.dev/157/)/[BIP158](https://bips.dev/158/)) downloads compact block filters and only fetches full blocks as needed.

- Trust‑minimized: No third‑party server dictates your view of the chain.
- Better privacy: Queries are not centralized on a single Electrum server.
- Simple setup: No Electrum URL to configure.

What’s new in v1
- Built‑in FLND (Flokicoin Lightning Network Daemon) for integrated Lightning operations.
- Modern addresses: segwit ([BIP173](https://bips.dev/173/)) and taproot ([BIP341](https://bips.dev/341/), [BIP342](https://bips.dev/342/)).
- Seed format: aezeed (LND seed, new format). Not compatible with [BIP39](https://bips.dev/39/).

:::important
Have a [BIP39](https://bips.dev/39/) seed? Use v0 to restore. v1 does not import [BIP39](https://bips.dev/39/).

### v0 — Electrum (legacy)

v0 connects to an Electrum server you specify (a server indexes the chain and answers wallet queries).

- You must configure `electserver = <host>:<port>`.
- Public Electrum endpoints previously listed are deprecated; run your own or use a trusted provider.
- Trade‑off: Simpler sync but you trust the server for your balance/tx history view.

Limitations in v0
- Addresses: legacy Flokicoin addresses only (no segwit/taproot generation).
- Seed format: [BIP39](https://bips.dev/39/) mnemonic (not compatible with v1’s aezeed).
