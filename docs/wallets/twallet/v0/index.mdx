v0 is the legacy tWallet line. It connects to an Electrum server that indexes the blockchain and serves wallet queries.

## Electrum
- Electrum is a light-client protocol: the server maintains an index; clients query balances, history, and broadcast transactions.
- Simplicity: Quick to get started, minimal sync.
- Trade-offs: You trust the server’s view of the chain. Public servers also see your query patterns.

### Electrum Setup

## tWallet Limitations v0 vs v1

- Addresses: legacy Flokicoin address format only (no segwit/taproot generation).
- No built‑in Lightning daemon (FLND is not included).
- Seed format: [BIP39](https://bips.dev/39/) mnemonic (different from v1’s aezeed).

:::tip
Restoring an existing [BIP39](https://bips.dev/39/) seed? Use v0. v1 (aezeed) is not compatible with [BIP39](https://bips.dev/39/).
:::

**Status:** Public Electrum endpoints previously listed are deprecated. Prefer your own server or a trusted community provider.

Extract and make the binary executable where applicable:

```bash
tar -xvf twallet-*.tar.gz
chmod +x twallet
```

## Configure

Create a `twallet.conf` next to the binary and point it to your Electrum server:

```ini title="twallet.conf (v0 minimal)"
electserver = electrum.example.com:50001
# timeout = 10s
```

Full sample (annotated):

```ini title="Full sample (v0)"
; Directory for the wallet database
; walletdir = /private/link/flc/db

; Network settings (only one can be true)
; If both regtest and testnet are false, mainnet will be used by default.
; Use the regression test network
; regtest = false
; Use the test network
; testnet = false

; Database connection timeout (in seconds)
timeout = 10s

; Electrum server configuration (host:port)
electserver = electrum.example.com:50001

# Fee for slow transactions (in loki/vB)
# feeslow = 1

# Fee for medium transactions (in loki/vB)
# feemedium = 2

# Fee for fast transactions (in loki/vB) # available on v0.1.1
# feefast = 3
```

## Run

On macOS/Linux:

```bash
./twallet
```

On Windows:

```powershell
twallet.exe
```

If your OS flags the binary, allow it explicitly.

## Releases

See the sidebar for the latest v0 release notes and assets.

## Security
- Back up your seed phrase (24 words recommended) and test recovery.
- Set a spending passphrase and lock your wallet when idle.
- Keep tWallet up to date: https://github.com/flokiorg/tWallet/releases
