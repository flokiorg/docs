This beta focuses on smoother startup/recovery flows, clearer onboarding, UI refinements, stronger caching, and refreshed dependencies.

## Changes

### Startup and recovery
- Added a guided recovery path that clears Neutrino cache files and restarts the wallet service when boot fails (press R on the splash screen).
- Startup now blocks until the service reports a healthy state; down/EOF conditions surface clear instructions to recover or exit.

### Restore and onboarding
- Restore flow monitors recovery progress, shows toast updates, and waits for RPC readiness before entering the main app.
- Seed create/restore transitions avoid premature navigation by tracking restore state and waiting for wallet availability.

### Wallet UI
- Switches/buttons gained configurable colors and keep active styling in sync with state.
- Copying the cipher now confirms via toast; receive flow messaging is clearer.
- TUI skips draws when the terminal reports zero dimensions and clears the screen after a valid size returns, preventing resize panics and stale frames.
- Balance header always shows unconfirmed funds even when locked funds are present to keep pending exposure consistent.

### Configuration and defaults
- Sample config documents `transactiondisplaylimit`, clarifying it caps the number of transactions shown (not fetched).
- CLI defaults now set a transaction display limit and clarify fee URL guidance; sample config documents the expected fee API response.

### Stability, caching, and monitoring
- Load cache now tracks balances and chain tip height; notifications update the tip on new blocks/transactions.
- Recovery monitoring retries until the wallet RPC is ready and reports recovery completion.

### Dependencies
- Bumped to `flnd` **v0.1.8-beta** and `walletd` **v0.1.5-beta**.
- VERSION set to **1.0.8-beta**.

## Config example

```ini title="twallet.conf snippet"
; Limit how many transactions are displayed (fetched set is unchanged)
transactiondisplaylimit=50
; Recommended fee endpoint format remains the same
feeurl=https://flokichain.info/api/v1/fees/recommended
```
