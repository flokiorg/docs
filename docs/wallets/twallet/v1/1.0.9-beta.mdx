This release integrates a dedicated internal Lightning connector and adds a configuration view for node management.

## Notable Changes

### Internal Lightning Connector
The wallet now implements an internal connector strategy. The connection management and service logic have been moved internally to `tWallet`, decoupling the application from the external `FLND` repository. This provides a stable, application-specific interface for all Lightning operations.

### Configuration Updates
- Added mapping for additional `flnd` configuration options and synchronized default values to ensure consistency with the core Lightning implementation.

### New: Lightning Configuration Modal
A new configuration modal is accessible via the `Ctrl+N` shortcut.

- **Connection Details**: Displays RPC Address, Peer Address, and Identity PubKey.
- **Credentials**: Exports Macaroon and TLS Certificate in hex format for configuring external tools like `LokiHub`, `flncli`, or web dashboards.
- **Clipboard**: Implements a new cross-platform copy mechanism with robust fallback support (OSC 52, native OS commands) for seamless use in local and remote environments.

### First Run Auto-Unlock
To support automated deployments and Ops workflows, a new `autounlock` configuration option has been added.
- **Automated Startup**: When enabled alongside `defaultpassword`, the wallet silently unlocks on the initial application run without requiring user interaction.
- **Stealth UI**: The unlock form is hidden during the automatic process, displaying only a status indicator.
- **Security**: This behavior is restricted to the first run only; subsequent manual locking/unlocking operations retain the standard password prompt for security.
